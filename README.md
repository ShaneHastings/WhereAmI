'Where Am I' intends to be a simple web app that allows me to track my location as I travel around Europe, and beyond. It should show a map of pinned locations with my previous visits and a text-based list of these too.

Updates to the travel map will be made through an authenticated side of the web app.

## Made using

 - LeafletJS
 - OpenStreetMap
